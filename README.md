# Chandrayaan 3 TDD Assessment

This is a test-driven development (TDD) project for the Chandrayaan 3 lunar spacecraft navigation program. The program translates commands sent from Earth into instructions understood by the spacecraft to navigate through the galaxy using galactic coordinates.

## Requirements

The following functionalities are implemented in the program:

1. Move the spacecraft forward/backward (f, b): The spacecraft moves one step forward or backward based on its current direction.
2. Turn the spacecraft left/right (l, r): The spacecraft rotates 90 degrees to the left or right, changing its facing direction.
3. Turn the spacecraft up/down (u, d): The spacecraft changes its angle, rotating upwards or downwards.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/chandrayaan-3-tdd-assessment.git
cd chandrayaan-3-tdd-assessment
